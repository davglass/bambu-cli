[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/bambu-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/bambu-cli) [![Release Build](https://github.com/davglass/bambu-cli/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/davglass/bambu-cli/actions/workflows/release.yml)

A simple CLI tool for BambuLab printers. Currently only tested with a pair of X1C's each with 2 AMS's.

## TODO

* ~~Add shortcuts~~
  * ~~Pass a partial machine name~~
  * ~~Pass a partial device id~~
  * ~~Truncate the comands:~~
    * ~~cli con (`bambu-cli config`)~~
    * ~~cli s (`bambu-cli status`)~~
    * ~~cli f xxx (`bambu-cli files [DEVICE ID]`)~~
    * ~~cli f 012 (`bambu-cli files [DEVICE ID]`)~~
* ~~Upload files to the ftp server~~.
* ~~Redact logging personal info for easier screenshots~~
* Run a background task that auto updates the config for filament type/color
* Trigger a print job from a file on the sdcard.
  * And choose a plate if file has more than one
  * Let the user override the filament type/color from AMS selection
* Test offline printers (mine are usually running).
* Get tests against other printer types (A1 & P1 series).
* Build a queue that would:
  * ~~Parse the file~~
  * ~~Know the colors needed~~
  * ~~Know which printer has the proper filament type/color~~
  * Know which printer is free
  * Send the file to the printer that is free and has the right filament type/color

## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and working on your computer. Use the LTS version.

    npm -g i bambu-cli

## Usage

The CLI startup will ask you to log into Bambu's main website to get a token and use that to gather machine info.
That is the only time the CLI will talk to the cloud, all other interactions are local between you and the printer.

It talks to the cloud to pull the list of devices you have bound to your account. Then it will attempt to listen to
the global MQTT server to get data from these devices (local IP). It then only saves that info locally so we can
talk to the printers over your local network.

## Login

`bambu-cli login` forces a login to refresh machine info.

## Config

`bambu-cli config` can be used with my other tool [Bambu Farm](https://github.com/davglass/bambu-farm)

    bambu-cli config
    {
        "username": "",
        "mqtt_user": "",
        "machines": [
            {
                "id": "",
                "name": "",
                "token": "",
                "ip": "",
                "model": "BL-P001",
                "make": "X1 Carbon"
            },
            {
                "id": "",
                "name": "",
                "token": "",
                "ip": "",
                "model": "BL-P001",
                "make": "X1 Carbon"
            }
        ]
    }

## Machines

This will list the machines known by the cli tool.

`bambi-cli machines/ls`

    bambu-cli ls
    Showing information about 2 machine(s)

    ID               Name        IP Address  Access Code

    [DEVICE ID]      [NAME]      [IP ADDR]   [ACCESS CODE]

## Status

Shows status of all printers, or detailed status of a selected printer

    bambu-cli status

## Files

Shows all .gcode/.3mf files on the local `ftp` server of the selected printer.

Add `--filter=<foo>` to limit the output. You can also pass `--download` to download all of the files shown from
the `ftp` server to your local machine. Replacing `--download` with `--parse` will parse meta data from the file. Using
`--delete` will delete the shown files.

    bambu-cli files [DEVICE ID] --filter "DL-44 Blaster.gco"

## Timelapse

Same as `files` except it shows the timelapse videos and allows you to download them the same way. `--delete` will also delete the remote files.

## Parse

This will parse a local `.gcode.3mf` file and show some details about it. Just added checking filaments against currently known printers and reporting which one a plate can be sent to.

## MQTT

This command is used for debugging MQTT traffic:

    bambu-cli mqtt --json //Prints all messages
    bambu-cli mqtt --json --keys //Prints the top level "keys"
    bambu-cli mqtt --json --keys ams //Prints only the `ams` key
    bambu-cli mq --path $..ams.ams[0].tray //Prints AMS 1 `tray` Array
    bambu-cli mq --path $..ams.ams[0].tray[1] //Prints AMS 1 `tray` at index 1 

Supports [JSONPath](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath#jsonpath-syntax) for filtering with `--path`
